The smooth leather looks nice but does show scratches and marks easily. I’ve had it for only a week and some wear is already visible and that’s something I do not like. I’m in the processing of ordering some leather care/conditioner to see if it’ll go away.",

Some styles are just too good to leave in the archives.Our Signature Jacquard is made with a blend of 44% recycled polyester and 56% regenerative cotton sourced from farms that use regenerative agricultural practices—those that help to maintain and rejuvenate land, increase biological diversity and soil health, and could lead to increased carbon absorption. It reflects our ongoing commitment to helping reduce our impact on the planet.",

The smooth leather looks nice but does show scratches and marks easily. I’ve had it for only a week and some wear is already visible and that’s something I do not like. I’m in the processing of ordering some leather care/conditioner to see if it’ll go away.",

I tried to email customer services but got no reply. I WhatsApp’d your Regent Street store who immediately confirmed I would receive the correct handbag. Thankfully it arrived 2 days later.

The leatherwork is amazing, fits anything you might need from a little to a lot, not bulky on the shoulder either!. I LOVE the center zippered sewn-in compartment. Brilliant! The maple brown is the perfect color and with the peanut butter color on the inside.... chef's kiss! Great job Coach!",

It is very spacious and holds all my cards, drivers license, insurance cards, some folded bills etc., and yet it is small compact card case when zipped shut. It zips easily when full. Quilting does make it little bulky, but it’s not as bad as other brands. I love it so much that I have it in all different colors. \n\nPS: I bought two in pebble leather version too (black and white) which are much more sleeker than quilted. But quilted looks very elegant so bought quilted version in all colors.",

Crafted of our lightweight Signature jacquard, this streamlined style is based on a 1980s Coach design reimagined for today. Featuring our iconic turnlock closure, the petite bag sits just beneath the underarm with the short chain strap or it can be carried as a clutch. Some styles are just too good to leave in the archives.Our Signature Jacquard is made with a blend of 44% recycled polyester and 56% regenerative cotton sourced from farms that use regenerative agricultural practices—those that help to maintain and rejuvenate land, increase biological diversity and soil health, and could lead to increased carbon absorption. It reflects our ongoing commitment to helping reduce our impact on the planet.",

The bluebell has a lot of gray in it when you are indoors, but I like the neutral color effect.  If is a great size when you want to be handsfree.  I have an Apple iphone 13 mini and it even fits in the back pocket although I don't think that would be the case with most standard size phones.  Inside I can put my keys and my thin, small Coach Rexy cardcase/wallet. Perfect for when I don't need anything more, which I think will be a lot this summer.  You know when you gets something int he mail and you start using it within a minute of opening the package.  That is how it was with this handbag.  And it is so beautiful too!  The color, the lightweight crossbody chain, and the quilted leather are all amazing.  I get so many compliments even though it is small and understated.",

The bluebell has a lot of gray in it when you are indoors, but I like the neutral color effect.  If is a great size when you want to be handsfree.  I have an Apple iphone 13 mini and it even fits in the back pocket although I don't think that would be the case with most standard size phones.  Inside I can put my keys and my thin, small Coach Rexy cardcase/wallet. Perfect for when I don't need anything more, which I think will be a lot this summer.  You know when you gets something int he mail and you start using it within a minute of opening the package.  That is how it was with this handbag.  And it is so beautiful too!  The color, the lightweight crossbody chain, and the quilted leather are all amazing.  I get so many compliments even though it is small and understated.",

I can’t wait to dress this bag up more,  perfect for scarves and charms when you want to add more visual interest/ keep it different. The double handles fit will on the forearm to carry around. It does have a crossbody strap, though I don’t see myself using it with this style bag regularly. This is an every season carry all bag. I appreciate the top zip to keep my stuff safe.",

It is very spacious and holds all my cards, drivers license, insurance cards, some folded bills etc., and yet it is small compact card case when zipped shut. It zips easily when full. Quilting does make it little bulky, but it’s not as bad as other brands. I love it so much that I have it in all different colors. \n\nPS: I bought two in pebble leather version too (black and white) which are much more sleeker than quilted. But quilted looks very elegant so bought quilted version in all colors.",

The vibrant yellow color adds a cheerful pop to any outfit, and the Disney touch brings just the right amount of nostalgia without feeling overdone.\n\nThe quality is everything you’d expect from Coach: buttery-soft leather, solid hardware, and meticulous stitching. The size is compact yet surprisingly roomy I can fit my essentials like phone, wallet, keys, and a lip balm with no problem. It works great as both a shoulder bag and a crossbody, thanks to the versatile strap options.\n\nWhether I’m heading out for errands or a casual brunch, this bag always draws compliments. If you’re a Disney lover who appreciates classic craftsmanship, this bag is a must-have in your collection!",

This is definitely the bag for those of us with Android phones which can be a bit larger than iPhones.  I can carry my keys, Samsung phone in it's case and my Coach wallet (6 1/2\" x 4\") with room for more items in the front pouch.  I usually only buy Coach items in my favorite pebbled leather, but the Crossgrain leather is beautiful, durable and silky smooth to the touch.

It is very spacious and holds all my cards, drivers license, insurance cards, some folded bills etc., and yet it is small compact card case when zipped shut. It zips easily when full. Quilting does make it little bulky, but it’s not as bad as other brands. I love it so much that I have it in all different colors. \n\nPS: I bought two in pebble leather version too (black and white) which are much more sleeker than quilted. But quilted looks very elegant so bought quilted version in all colors.",

As such you will get clipped enamel/paint. It does feel rough but the wearing of the charm seems to help the rough clipped feel. Clipping on mine has been both feet (toes) and the tail . I tool off the key ring part because I figured it would cause more scratches but take away from it being a charm vs key ring. But I get so many compliments from the cutest Rexy charm ever 💕🦖💕",

It’s also very heavy and weighs down my purse strap when worn. I’ve had it since mid December, I would wear it every other day. The bottom charm is already heavily scratched/dented on the surface in certain places where they seem to clash together the most, so much so it’s showing the silver underneath. It’s very cute and I wanted to love this product but I am disappointed on the longevity of the appearance. This is not an “everyday” bag charm, keep that in mind if you buy. The other coach dice charm doesn’t seem to have this problem, I’m assuming because of the material, if it was more similar in that aspect I would have absolutely loved this product.",

It reflects our ongoing commitment to helping reduce our impact on the planet.",

The vibrant yellow color adds a cheerful pop to any outfit, and the Disney touch brings just the right amount of nostalgia without feeling overdone.\n\nThe quality is everything you’d expect from Coach: buttery-soft leather, solid hardware, and meticulous stitching. The size is compact yet surprisingly roomy I can fit my essentials like phone, wallet, keys, and a lip balm with no problem. It works great as both a shoulder bag and a crossbody, thanks to the versatile strap options.\n\nWhether I’m heading out for errands or a casual brunch, this bag always draws compliments. If you’re a Disney lover who appreciates classic craftsmanship, this bag is a must-have in your collection!",
