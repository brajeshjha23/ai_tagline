The smooth leather looks nice but does show scratches and marks easily. I’ve had it for only a week and some wear is already visible and that’s something I do not like. I’m in the processing of ordering some leather care/conditioner to see if it’ll go away.",

I purchased the bag as an 18th Birthday gift for my daughter via WhatsApp. \nI then started to receive emails regarding a different handbag I hadn’t ordered. This obviously set me into a panic! I tried to email customer services but got no reply. I WhatsApp’d your Regent Street store who immediately confirmed I would receive the correct handbag. Thankfully it arrived 2 days later. Not sure what happened but there is clearly a GDPR issue as I have someone else’s name and address attached to my email details!",

Some styles are just too good to leave in the archives.Our Signature Jacquard is made with a blend of 44% recycled polyester and 56% regenerative cotton sourced from farms that use regenerative agricultural practices—those that help to maintain and rejuvenate land, increase biological diversity and soil health, and could lead to increased carbon absorption. It reflects our ongoing commitment to helping reduce our impact on the planet.",
